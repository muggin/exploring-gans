# Basic GANs
#### Training with very high learning rate
performance_1_old - latent dim equal to image dim, eta=0.01, no do, SGD
performance_2_old - latent dim equal to image dim, eta=0.01, no do, SGD
performance_3_old - latent dim equal to image dim, eta=0.01, no do, SGD
All three models above have very similary params, hard to say what was changed.

# Description:
performance_2_old:
To try to avoid divergence in the generator error, we tried training G and D equally up to 130 iterations (when it seemed to start diverging), and then train G twice as much as D from there. This experiment was run with smoothed G-labels and very small amount of noise in D. 

performance_3_old:
trained with ReLU rather than leakyReLU, the error of G diverges rapidly

performance_4_old:
training the generator every other step, we see a complementary pattern between mode collapses

samples_4_old:
a mode collapse can also be on a saddle point between two of our targets. This seems like a mix between 6 and 9.

samples_5_old:
higher learning rate and momentum makes the learning stabilize but on strange point

#### Training with lower learning rate, raw data
performance_1_e - latent dim 100, eta=0.0005, do=0.3, SGD, ReLU, linear output - d&g trained equally, raw data
performance_2_e - latent dim 100, eta=0.0005, do=0.0, SGD, ReLU, linear output - d&g trained equally, raw data
performance_3_e - latent dim 100, eta=0.0005, do=0.0, SGD, ReLU, tanh output - d&g trained equally, raw data
All values are very high so the output images seem to be very noisy, high values dominate the output.
