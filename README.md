# Exploring GANs
The goal of this project was to explore the landscape of Generative Adversarial Networks applied to the problem of image generation. 

Two GAN architectures were implemented from scratch based on the following publications:
- ["Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional GANs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) by Radford et al.
- [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) by Goodfellow et al.

Other architectures were explored using code provided by the authors.


The project was carried out as part of the DD2424 "Deep Learning for Data Science" course at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](http://kth.se).
