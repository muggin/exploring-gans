# Exploring GANs
The goal of this project was to explore the landscape of Generative Adversarial Networks applied to the problem of image generation. Multiple GAN architectures were tested on images coming from two datasets. The final report is available [here](/misc/final-report.pdf).

This project was carried out as part of the DD2424 "Deep Learning for Data Science" course at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](http://kth.se).

### References
Two GAN architectures were implemented from scratch based on the following publications:
- ["Generative Adversarial Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) by Goodfellow et al.
- ["Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional GANs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) by Radford et al.

Other architectures were explored using code provided by the authors of publications.

### Datasets
The experiments were conducted using two datasets:
- [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) - the classic dataset containing images of handwritten digits
- [Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) - dataset containing cropped images of human faces
